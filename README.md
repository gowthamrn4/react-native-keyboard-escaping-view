Solving the problem with not worked KeyboardAvoidView in React Native

&lt;KeyboardEscapingView/&gt; - use this instead &lt;KeyboardAvoidingView/&gt; - just wrap in this component all, what should be moved on keyboard motion. 
If you also want use ScrollView inside this area - use &lt;ScrollViewForKeyboard/&gt; inside &lt;KeyboardEscapingView/&gt;

For my tasks all is working on Android and iOS both.

Good luck!
