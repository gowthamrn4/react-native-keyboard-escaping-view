Solving the problem with not worked KeyboardAvoidView in React Native

<KeyboardEscapingView/> - use this instead <KeyboardAvoidingView/> - just wrap in this component all, what should be moved on keyboard motion. 
If you also want use ScrollView inside this area - use <ScrollViewForKeyboard/> inside <KeyboardEscapingView/>

For my tasks all is working on Android and iOS both.

Good luck!
